LancsSearch

This project was built with the purpose of making it easier for people to find mental health and social support in the East Lancashire area by centralising those organisations into a searchable database. The UI is simple and straight-forward.
Users can create an account where they can favourite organisations and submit new ones to be added to the database for others.

I used Vue.js and Laravel, and Inertia to allow server-side rendering.

In the future I hope to implement a "notice board" on the landing page where local events can be posted.
